# :computer: Bandersnatch :movie_camera:
[Bandersnatch Life](http://bandersnatch.life) is an interactive website for the movie Black Mirror: Bandersnatch by Netflix. [Bandersnatch Life](http://bandersnatch.life) allows you to explore all possible paths in an interactive way - and in my opinion is a must to fully absorb all possible outcomes of the movie!

* Informational Notifications - Some are Timed

* Paths Explorations

## Inspiration :notebook:

> ##### You will fail.
> 
> You will mess up.
> 
> You'll do poorly on assignments and tests.
> 
> Your side projects will not work.
> 
> Your code will be sloppy and incomplete.
> 
> You will bomb job interviews.
> 
> Your PR's will be rejected.
> 
> And because you fail, you will succeed.
> 
> Don't be afraid to fail, don't let it destroy your self-confidence, don't let it define you. Instead, do everything you can to learn from that failure and take that new knowledge into the next piece of work.
> 
> Indeed, failure is the only path to success.
